# OS Architecture

## IO pathways

Device controller tells the CPU it's done (put data into a buffer) by sending an interrupt.

IO goes from controller - local buffer - CPU

## Interrupts

Hardware interrupts

- A buffer has been filled

Traps or exceptions are software generated interrupts

- User requests
- Errors

Most operating systems are interrupt driven.

## Storage structures


### Main memory (DRAM)

- Random Access
- Lost with power outage (volatile)

### Secondary storage

- Larger
- Not lost with power outage (non-volatile)

### Caching

Copying data from secondary storage to main memory

- Faster

Storage Hierarchy
Registers > cache > main memory (dram) > solid-state disks > spinning disks > optical disks > magnetic tapes.

### Direct memory access (DMA)

Some amount of DRAM is owned directly by an IO controller, and uses the DRAM for the buffer.
When done, the IO controller sends an interrupt.

## Processing

- **Asymmetric** - each processor does a specific task.
- **Symmetric** - each processor performs all tasks.

### Multithreading


While one thread is asking for memory, execute the other thread. Go back and forth.

### Dual mode

User mode and Kernel mode, with a mode bit.
Kernel mode is also called privileged.

#### System calls

System calls are how user mode apps interact with the kernel.
APIs are provided facilities to access the kernel without using system calls (which may not be allowed)

- Win32 for Windows
- POSIX API (Unix, Linux, Mac OS X)
- Java API for Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

## Load averages

Windows will show a percentage of CPU. Linux systems instead show the number of processes waiting to acces the CPU. It can get to double digits.

### Threading

A single-thread process has a program counter that says "go here to read the next instruction please"

## Memory management

Copying from storage into dram, into cache. Only stuff in L1 cache can be executed.

```console
           0.5 ns - CPU L1 dCACHE reference
           1   ns - speed-of-light (a photon) travel a 1 ft (30.5cm) distance
           5   ns - CPU L1 iCACHE Branch mispredict
           7   ns - CPU L2  CACHE reference
          71   ns - CPU cross-QPI/NUMA best  case on XEON E5-46*
         100   ns - MUTEX lock/unlock
         100   ns - own DDR MEMORY reference
         135   ns - CPU cross-QPI/NUMA best  case on XEON E7-*
         202   ns - CPU cross-QPI/NUMA worst case on XEON E7-*
         325   ns - CPU cross-QPI/NUMA worst case on XEON E5-46*
      10,000   ns - Compress 1K bytes with Zippy PROCESS
      20,000   ns - Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps NETWORK
     250,000   ns - Read 1 MB sequentially from MEMORY
     500,000   ns - Round trip within a same DataCenter
  10,000,000   ns - DISK seek
  10,000,000   ns - Read 1 MB sequentially from NETWORK
  30,000,000   ns - Read 1 MB sequentially from DISK
 150,000,000   ns - Send a NETWORK packet CA -> Netherlands
|   |   |   |
|   |   | ns|
|   | us|
| ms|

## Debugging


Kernighan's Law

> Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you’re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
> -- Brian Kernighan, 1974

Write easy to understand code, planning on future debugging.

## Communications models

### Message passing (modern)

- Puts messages into a shared queue, gives it a number, tell the other app "Go read this message"

### Shared memory (ancient)

- Applications can just overwrite each others data.

### Scheduling

- **FCFS** - First come First Served. Not really used anymore
- **SJF** - Shortest Job first, kind-of how QoS works.
- **Priority** - Give processes an integer, rank them.
- **RR** - Round Robin, using time quantum, called q like 10-100 milliseconds
- **CFS** - *Completely Fair Scheduler
  * Involved, emulates time-slices
  * N tasks, each task gets 1/N time.

### Multilevel queue - done in Linux

- Foreground, Background
  * Foreground gets 80% as RR

- Background
  * FCFS
  
## Process environment

- Argument vector - the command line arguments used to invoke the running program
- Environment vector - the list of "NAME=VALUE" pairs

## Static and dynamic linking

- **Static** - the library functions are embedded in the executable.
- **Dynamic** - the library functions are at a place in memory, and shared.

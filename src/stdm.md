# STDM

The common STDM system in the US is T-Carrier.

STDM
: Synchronous Time-Division Multiplexing

DS0
: Level 0. One timeslot.
  - A timeslot carries 8 bits. 
  - Frame rate is 8000 Hz. 8 × 8000 = 64 Kbps.

B8ZS
: Binary Eight Zero Substitution. 
  - A special way to encode `0000 0000` for DS0 lines.

T1 Frame
: T-Carrier, Level 1. 
  - Aggregates 24 DS0 frames, or 192 bits.
  - The T1 gets an extra bit for framing, so 193. 193 × 8000 = 1.544 Mbps.

Super Frame
: 12 T1 frames.

Framing Search
: Each T1 frame uses the extra bit to encode part of the superframe bit pattern
  - `0101 1101 0001`, or (5, 13, 1).

APS
: Automatic Protection Switching.
  - The device engaging in APS sends the data on *both* links, the working link and the protected link. 
  - The receiving device devices which to use.

DS1
: Data Stream, Level 1.

T1
: T-Carrier, Level 1.
  - Carries 24 DS0 frames, or 192 bits.
  - The T1 gets an extra bit for framing, so 193. 193 × 8000 = 1.544 Mbps.

ACR
: Access Circuit Redundancy.

## Cisco CEM Terms

- **ACR** - Adaptive Clock Recovery, A technique to recovery the clock based on the fill level of the jitter buffer.

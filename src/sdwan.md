# SD-WAN

## Theory

## Terms

- **DIA:** Direct Internet Access. What we usually have has residential customers. No real guarantee of service, but tends to be fast.
- **SLA:** Service Level Agreement. Business Internet, especially, to connect sites together tends to have a SLA.
- **MPLS:** A kind of VPN service provided by an ISP, to connect business sites together. Comes with a SLA. More expensive than DIA.
- **BFD:** Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

## Devices


- **Manager:** AKA vManage, AKA, the NMS. What a human interacts with, the GUI
- **Validator:** AKA vBond. Initial Authentication and provisioning, (Cisco calls this orchestration) Responsible for NAT traversal.
- **Controller:** AKA vSmart. Holds the current state of the network, (routes and data policy) maintains active connections to the edges and programs them.
- **WAN Edge:** AKA vEdge. What gets programmed. Provides data-plane between sites, via circuits like DIA, or MPLs.
- **vEDGE:** Old hardware-based Viptela gear, pre-Cisco acquisition. Unfavored.

## Marketing Terms

- **Cisco SD-WAN Cloud OnRamp:** AKA, CoR. Edges can perform analytics to SaaS or IaaS offerings to select the best path, via jitter.

## Validator

Should be give a FQDN, so WAN edges have no problems finding it on connection to a DIA.

FQDNs also mean we aren't putting a static IP into a config.

Initial authentication is done with PKI, and RSA encryption.

Can not be placed behind NAT, unless the NAT device does a 1:1 static translation.

This device does the load balancing if multiple controllers are being used.

The Validator has a permanent dTLS tunnel to all the controllers.

## Controllers

- Keeps all the routes between sites, that are managed via the OMP protocol (like BGP, but proprietary)
- Logical tunnel topologies (such as hub and spoke, regional, and partial mesh)
- Service Chaining
- Traffic Engineering
- Segmentation per VPN


## WAN Edge

- Dataplane for a site
- Has OMP, BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, ACLs, ARP, HA, and QoS.
- Connects via dTLS to the controllers.
- Connects via dTLS to other edges.

## SD-WAN Policy

Policies are further classified as

- **Local Policy:** Programed on the edges. ACLs, QoS, routing, and AAA.
- **Centralized Policy:** Route policy, before being sent to the edges, (Topology, VPN Membership, Application Aware Routing)

## Application Aware Routing

- **FEC:** Forward Error Correction. For every four packets, send a parity packet. It can help rebuild a lost packet.
- **Packet Duplication:** Send twice as much data via two tunnels. The receiving vEdge router can reconstruct it.
- **TCP Optimization and Session Persistence:** For high-latency links like satellite, open one TCP session, proxy it, and reuse it.
- **Data Redundancy Elimination:** DRE. Modern compression to get more bandwidth from WAN links.
- For AAR, or CoR, the edge will send HTTP probes and measure the jitter and/or loss.
- The score for an app is the vQoS (Viptela Quality of Experience) from 0 to 10, 10 being best.

## VPNs


**VPN0:** Underlay Signaling, transport WAN. Typically public addresses or SRC-NAT Public addresses.

**VPN512:** OOB Management

**VPNn:** Any number from 1 to 65527. Not 0. Not 512. Used for service-side (also known as LAN-side) traffic.



## Commands

```console
!
! Control Setup
!
show sdwan control local-properties

show sdwan control connection-history
!
! CMP
!
show sdwan omp peers
show sdwan omp routes

```

## Initial Bringup


### Pasting in the bootstrap

```console
tclsh
puts [open "bootflash:name-of-bootstrap-file.cfg" w+] {
<list of certs goes here>
<must be done via an actual terminal>
<like SecureCRT>
<with character and line send delay>
}
```

### Copy via HTTP using Python

1. Get the current IP

```console
python -c "import socket; s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM); s.connect(('8.8.8.8', 80)); print(s.getsockname()[0]); s.close()"
```

1. Start the server with above IP

```console
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 10.0.0.1
```

1. Copy into cisco box

```console
copy tftp://10.0.0.1:8000/<boot-strap>.cfg bootflash:/<bootstrap>.cfg
```

**controller-mode enable**
